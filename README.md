# rapidHack

Welcome to the repo for the rapidHack event started by [Josh Harrington](https://twitter.com/Josh_Harrington), hosted by [Reading Room](http://www.readingroom.com/).

The site is hosted [here](http://joshharrington.github.io/rapidhack/).

The point of this **mini** hackathon event is to encourage creative collaboration, to help people realise how amazing the people they work with are and to give them a break from the constraints of normal client projects.
