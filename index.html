<p>Thanks for your interest in rapidHack!
<br>We'll be holding this Hackathon at the Reading Room offices.</p>
<h3>TIME & DATE : 6-10pm, May 5th.</h3>
<p>We'll have lots of food and drinks, just bring your laptop and creative spirit. </p>
<p>Here's the format for the evening:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Quick introduction</li>
    <li>Explanation of a few different "problems". You can pick one of these or one of your own.</li>
    <li>Get into groups</li>
    <li>Hack!</li>
</ul>

<p>While using software is great, we understand it isn't necessarily the best (or easiest or fastest) solution to a problem, so we're encouraging you to think outside of the box. Feel free to go with whatever you and your group thinks is the best solution to the problem you're working on, whether that's coding, a pen and paper, a prototype, whatever! It doesn't even have to be completely finished, just enough so that it gives a good idea of how it could work.
<br><br>All the ideas will be shown the next day during a quick, elevator-pitch style presentation - this is not something you need to spend half and hour preparing for, you just need know the point of your idea and be able to explain it clearly in 30 seconds. 
<br><br>If you sign up and it turns out you can't make it, please speak to Josh Harrington or Hayleigh Wronski. </p>
